# Feature.Template

A template for a feature

## To use

- Clone this repo
- Uncomment the `Test` folder entry in the `.gitignore` file. This is so you can have ugly internal testing and Examples separate which lowers chance of pushing private api-keys to github (At the cost of copying stuff to the `Examples` folder every now and again)
